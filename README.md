# iris-flower-classification

Iris flower classification using supervised ML.

## Overview

This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset which contains 150 samples with 4 features each: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, and Petal width. The dataset is stored in the `iris.data` file.

## Files

- `main.py`: The main script that loads the data, trains the SVM model, evaluates its performance, and makes predictions.
- `iris.data`: The dataset file containing the iris flower measurements.
- `SVM.pickle`: The serialized SVM model.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
